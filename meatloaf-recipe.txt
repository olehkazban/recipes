*The addition of 1 or 2 teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet® makes this recipe very good.
**Recipe should be"plump" from the addition of the milk or Half & Half.
It should NOT be runny.
***A second batch of sauce served hot is good to serve with the meatloaf.
Nita's Note: I note that some of you are using game meat such as deer -- Deer is a very DRY meat. It is wise to HAVE some fat added to the deer -- especially to ground deer. Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult and expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman.
